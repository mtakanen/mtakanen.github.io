# Hello World



## Experiential


## XYZ
Wikipedia knows the domain level domain name xyz is derived from the idea that domain names should end in the same way that the alphabeths do. 
Well, in Finnish we a few more, åäö. I wonder why that is not available. The xyz.com markets itself as domain for the next generation. 
Generation XYZ combines Generations X, Y and Z to create a global community inspired by the Internet and its limitless potential. 
I like that but also derived another meaning from [Cartesian coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). 
XYZ are the three degrees of freedom I operate in the outdoors. The first dimension X is a straight line, the XY plane represents horizontal movement and Z vertical. 


## Photography
I often go to trips with camera. My trips are always time boxed. For that reason I rarely go for photography only. 
For instance in landscape photography most of the time is spent finding the optimal perspective and waiting for the best available light conditions. 
Those failing going back home with empty memory card, returning spot the next available time slot. 
I want to exprience more and I'm willing to trade of quality of the shots. On the other hand I'm not interested in, although sometimes fallback, 
taking basic snapshots just for documenting the trip. On most trips I bring a full sensor DSLR and at least one quality lens. Rarely I take two lenses and a tripod.
