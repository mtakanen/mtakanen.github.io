In 2014 I travelled on water. Frozen or unfrozen. Frozen bodies of water had been accessible earlier by skates and skis. 
Previous summer I had swim hiked a couple of times but only after buying a packraft I got unlimited access to the numerous waters in Finland.

Early winter was mild. Small bodies of water had once frozen in December but sea remained completely ice free over the New year. 
I went on the first trip in January the 5th. It was a day trip paddle to Stenskär, the outernmost islet in Espoo archipelago. 
Winter is the only possible time to visit the islet as it's been protected for bird nesting in summertime. 
Weather was easy: +5 C, almost calm sea.

By the end of the second week the Big Freezer was switched on. Water temperatures in the lakes were already close to the freezing point. 
It didn't take long to see ice developing again. I went watching it in Meiko.

Temperatures dropped to around -15C. It took only a few days and lake ice was thick enough to walk. 
We went on midweek overnighter in Meiko to celebrate the start of winter with Joni. 
Found a tent sauna and enjoyed full moon and starry sky by the fire.

By Friday sea ice was solid enough for skating. Even Espoonjoki river was mostly frozen. I skate-commuted with Tuomas.

Over the same week I found myself seeking for a bigger skating adventure. Cold period seemed to open a rare opportunity on one of the 
biggest lakes in Finland. Lake Päijänne seldom freezes during a single period of cold days. Often it snows in some part before the 
biggest opens had frozen. The challenge was to skate from Jyväskylä to Vääksy (110 km) and ultimately to Lahti (130 km) in a day 
if conditions and logistics allowed. I asked Xavier to join and he was in. We made it to Vääksy but it turned out quite an adventure! 
I'm planning to write a detailed post of the trip later.
