In 2014 I travelled most on water. Frozen and unfrozen. I had bought a packraft.

Early winter had been mild, small bodies of water had once frozen in December but sea was completely ice free. 
The first trip of the year was a day trip paddle to Stenskär, the outernmost islet in Espoo archipelago. 
Winter is the only time to visit the islet as it's been protected for bird nesting in summertime. 
Weather was easy, +5 C, calm sea.

In the end of the second week the Big Freezer was switched on. Water temperatures in lakes were already close to the freezing point. 
It didn't take long to see ice developing again. I went watching it in Meiko.

Temperatures dropped to around -15C. It took only a few days ice was thick enough to walk. 
We went on midweek overnighter with Joni to celebrate the start of winter. 
We found a tent sauna and enjoyed full moon and clear sky by the fire.

By Friday same week sea ice close to the shores was solid enough for skating. I commuted by skating for the first time with Tuomas. 
Even Espoonjoki river was frozen.

I found myself seeking for a bigger skating adventure The cold period seemed to open a rare opportunity. Lake Päijänne is one of the biggest lakes in Finland. It seldom freezes completely from North to South without getting snow cover in some part.
