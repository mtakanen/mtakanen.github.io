In 2014 I travelled most on water. Frozen and unfrozen. I had bought a packraft.

Early winter had been mild, small bodies of water had once frozen in December but sea was completely ice free. 
The first trip of the year was a day trip paddle to Stenskär, the outernmost islet in Espoo archipelago. 
Winter is the only time to visit the islet as it's been protected for bird nesting in summertime. 
Weather was easy, +5 C, calm sea.

In the end of the second week the Big Freezer was switched on. Small water temperatures were already close to the freezing point. 
It didn't take long to see ice developing again in the lakes. I went watching it in Meiko.

It didn't take more than a couple of days ice was thick enough to walk. We went on midweek overnighter with Joni to celebrate the start of winter. 
We found a tent sauna and enjoyed full moon and clear sky by the fire.
