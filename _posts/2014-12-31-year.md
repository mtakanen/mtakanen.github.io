In 2014 I travelled on water. Frozen or unfrozen. Frozen bodies of water had been accessible earlier by skates and skis. 
Previous summer I had swim hiked a couple of times but only after buying a packraft I got unlimited access to the numerous waters in Finland.

# January

Early winter was mild. Small bodies of water had once frozen in December but sea remained completely ice free over the New year. 
I went on the first trip in January the 5th. It was a day trip paddle to Stenskär, the outernmost islet in Espoo archipelago. 
Winter is the only possible time to visit the islet as it's been protected for bird nesting in summertime. 
Weather was easy: +5 C, almost calm sea.

By the end of the second week the Big Freezer was switched on. Water temperatures in the lakes were already close to the freezing point. 
It didn't take long to see ice developing again. I went watching it in Meiko.

Temperatures dropped to around -15C. It took only a few days and lake ice was thick enough to walk. 
We went on midweek overnighter in Meiko to celebrate the start of winter with Joni. 
Found a tent sauna and enjoyed full moon and starry sky by the fire.

By Friday sea ice was solid enough for skating. Even Espoonjoki river was mostly frozen. I skate-commuted with Tuomas.

Over the same week I found myself seeking for a bigger skating adventure. Cold period seemed to open a rare opportunity on one of the 
biggest lakes in Finland. Lake Päijänne seldom freezes during a single period of cold days. Often it snows in some part before the 
biggest opens had frozen. The challenge was to skate from Jyväskylä to Vääksy (110 km) and ultimately to Lahti (130 km) in a day 
if conditions and logistics allowed. I asked Xavier to join and he was in. We made it to Vääksy and it turned out quite an adventure! 
I'm planning to write a detailed post of the trip later.

In the end of January I went on a few day trips on the sea ice. One was a Skrinnari club tour with a small group. 
Our target was to reach the tip of Porkkala from Suvisaaristo. Ice conditions and heavy snowing forced us to turn back 4 km before 
the target. Porkkala is a classic skating destination but was unreachable this winter. On the way back found a moose fallen through ice.

# February

I started planning the main trip of winter season, a hike on Archipelago Sea. Depending on the route open ship lane crossing might be 
necessary. We went practising different crossing techniques in Inkoo with Alpo.

Not owning a dry-suit I tried to find an unassisted crossing technique using a packraft. I capsized the boat and half swam on my first try but managed cross the lead.

Ice was not skateable due snowfall. Not a problem, skiing on sea ice great too, speed is just slower. 
On a daytrip South of Suvisaaristo I found Mt. Cloaca near Gåsgrund island.

In February full moon date I went on overnighter with Ilari. Normally it's the coldest time of year, in 2014 winter seemed to be ending. 
Sea rescue warned about weak ice on the sea. Ice felt mostly solid as we skied from the office in Keilalahti to outer archipelago.
The challenge was to reach Stenskär islet. South of Knapperskär island ice conditions turned quite exciting. 
In addition to rafted ice there was an open ship lane we would need to cross. We decided not to try crossing it in the dark. 
We turned back to Knapperskär and "summited" the islet in the next morning.

I spent my first week of winter holiday on the cottage in Central Finland with family. There was still enough snow for skiing.

A long period of overcast cleared the last week of February. A bit of sunshine finally! I was optimistic winter would kick back. 
My planned hike on Archipelago 
sea required a cold week or two. Skated back to work on barely tolerable ice to wait ice grow larger.

Unfortunately, another low pressure front arrived from South West resulting ice fields shrinking. Espoonjoki lost ice it's sheet. 
Rafted down the river...

...and stepped on the ice in Espoonlahti to skate a small tour. Winte paddling and skating has synergy. 
In both one has to be prepared for swimming in cold water.

# March
I lost hope on skiing or skating on Archipelago Sea and started looking North. I joined Korpijaakko's Sarek group in the last minute. 
Sarek had enough snow for skiing.

Weather was rainy and windy all week. In the second tent day, we did a small adventure on Vuojatädno river with Kaisa and Ilkka.

After Sarek trip winter was over in the South. The last week of March we did almost summer style packrafting trip on Siuntionjoki river with Joni.
