# Summary
In 2014 I travelled on water. Frozen or unfrozen. Frozen bodies of water had been accessible earlier by skates and skis. 
Previous summer I had swim hiked a couple of times but only after buying a packraft I got unlimited access to the numerous waters in Finland.

# Winter
Early winter was mild. Small bodies of water had once frozen in December but sea remained completely ice free over the New year. 

## January
I went on the first trip in January the 5th. It was a day trip paddle to Stenskär, the outernmost islet in Espoo archipelago. 
Winter is the only possible time to visit the islet as it's been protected for bird nesting in summertime. 
Weather was easy: +5 C, almost calm sea.

By the end of the second week the Big Freezer was switched on. Water temperatures in the lakes were already close to the freezing point. 
It didn't take long to see ice developing again. I went watching it in Meiko.

Meiko is a Natura 2000 protected area in our western neighbour municipal Kirkkonummi. I first visited it previous Autumn and liked it 
immediately. 

Temperatures dropped to around -15C. It took only a few days and lake ice was thick enough to walk. 
We went on midweek overnighter in Meiko to celebrate the start of winter with Joni. As Meiko didn't have any lean-tos and windchill was 
quite cold we went to East end of the lake where I recalled seeing a frame of a tent sauna.
We rigged the sheets and enjoyed full moon and starry sky by the fire.

By Friday sea ice was solid enough for skating. Even Espoonjoki river was mostly frozen. I skate-commuted with Tuomas.

Over the same week I found myself seeking for a bigger skating adventure. Cold period seemed to open a rare opportunity on one of the 
biggest lakes in Finland. Lake Päijänne seldom freezes during a single period of cold days. Often it snows in some part before the 
biggest opens had frozen. The challenge was to skate from Jyväskylä to Vääksy (130 km) and ultimately to Lahti (150 km) in a day 
if conditions and logistics allowed. I asked Xavier to join and he was in. 
{% include youtube.html src="www.youtube.com/embed/4eUfo0x7qOI" %}

We made it to Vääksy and it turned out quite an adventure! 
I'm planning to write a detailed post of the trip later.

In the end of January I went on a few day trips on the sea ice. One was a Skrinnari club tour with a small group. 
Our target was to reach the tip of Porkkala from Suvisaaristo. Ice conditions and heavy snowing forced us to turn back 4 km before 
the target. Porkkala is a classic skating destination but was unreachable this winter. On the way back found a moose fallen through ice.

## February

I started planning the main trip of winter season, a hike on Archipelago Sea. Depending on the route open ship lane crossing might be 
necessary. We went practising different crossing techniques in Inkoo with Alpo. 
{% include image_full.html src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/12269267566_a70758831f_k.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/12269267566/" width="100%" description="Alpo crossing in Inkoo." %}

Not owning a dry-suit I tried to find an unassisted crossing technique using a packraft. I capsized the boat and half swam on my first try but managed cross the lead.

Ice was not skateable due snowfall. Not a problem, skiing on sea ice great too, speed is just slower. 
On a daytrip South of Suvisaaristo I found Mt. Cloaca near Gåsgrund island.

In February full moon date I went on overnighter with Ilari. Normally it's the coldest time of year, in 2014 winter seemed to be ending. 
Sea rescue warned about weak ice on the sea. Ice felt mostly solid as we skied from the office in Keilalahti to outer archipelago.
The challenge was to reach Stenskär islet. South of Knapperskär island ice conditions turned quite exciting. 
In addition to rafted ice there was an open ship lane we would need to cross. We decided not to try crossing it in the dark. 
We turned back to Knapperskär and "summited" the islet in the next morning.

I spent my first week of winter holiday on the cottage in Central Finland with family. There was still enough snow for skiing.

A long period of overcast cleared the last week of February. A bit of sunshine finally! I was optimistic winter would kick back. 
My planned hike on Archipelago 
sea required a cold week or two. Skated back to work on barely tolerable ice to wait ice grow larger.
{% include image.html src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7436/12791224563_ce639d5f0e_b.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/12791224563/in/set-72157641555897414/" width="100%" description="Skate commute 3" %}

Unfortunately, another low pressure front arrived from South West resulting ice fields shrinking. Espoonjoki lost it's ice sheet. 
So I rafted down the river...

...and stepped on the ice in Espoonlahti to skate a small tour. Winter paddling and skating have a common hazard. 
In both one has to be prepared for swimming in cold water. I always have dry-sacked set of change clothes in backpack.

## March
By March I had lost all hope of skiing or skating on Archipelago Sea and started looking North. 
I joined Korpijaakko's Sarek group in the last minute. It would be news if Sarek had not enough snow for skiing in March. 

{% include image_full.html src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7235/13297429624_492ab63a85_k.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/13297429624/in/set-72157642660704064" description="Sarek storm" %}

And snow we found. Weather was humid and very windy all week. Frequent snow storms forced us to take the shortcut route.
{% include youtube.html src="www.youtube.com/embed/ken7tcMD9NM" %}

Later during the second tent day we went on sub adventure on Vuojatädno river with Kaisa and Ilkka. Ice was about meter thick but still unpredictable due to heavy variation (30 meters!) in water level of the underlying Akkajaure reservoir.  
{% include image_wide.html src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7015/13453977584_ebcdaf9c92_h.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/13453977584/in/set-72157643024162645" description="Vuojatädno" %}

Almost all outdoorsy people I know in Finland below the 67th latitude North kept complining winter was the worst winter ever. 
I agree if I think about cross-country skiing in sunshine. It was difficult to find enough snow for skiing and clouds were constantly 
blocking the Sun. In the end, I found different winter quite rewarding. It taught me to be more agile, to do what conditions allow 
and not planning too much ahead. It can be worse!

# Spring
After Sarek trip winter was over in the South. The last week of March we went on packrafting overnighter on Siuntionjoki river with Joni.
{% include image_full.html src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/13495989914_4fc7856f0b_k.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/13495989914/in/set-72157643229005205" description="Siuntio Spring break" %}

Despite minimal melt water discharge, water level was adequate for paddling the wild section from Sågarsfors to Purnus. 
Ice on river banks and on Tjusträsk lake spiced paddling.  In addition, -6 C degrees night in my +7 C limit summer sleeping bag 
delivered true shoulder season experience.

## April
{% include image_full.html src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/13829052963_50c37fbb9d_k.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/13829052963/in/set-72157643856152914" description="Myllykoski BW1" %}
I was taking photos in Myllykoski Big Water Festival white water racing event. It was the only occasion I didn't participate action, 
just kept pressing the shutter release button of the camera. Water discharge was low but it didn't slow down competitors. White water racing
looks exciting, it reminded me of skateboard slalom racing which I did earlier a bit. I was not tempted to try this, though.

A misty Sunday I went walking in Meiko. I always try to make best of available weather and bog felt to be best fit. Slätmossen is 
a mid-size bog in Southern Finland scale and completely unexploited. I was having a cup of coffee when I saw shades of grey layering 
behind the mire. Before finishing my coffee I had composed one more layer in the front.

{% include image_wide.html src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15707420469_66d27c49df_h.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/15707420469/in/set-72157649082476367" description="Slätmossen layers" %}

Tuesday next week we went on overnighter in Slätmossen to watch fullmoon with Joni. We camped on an island in the middle of the bog.
{% include image_full.html src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7530/16061647408_a22f50b6de_k.jpg" link="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/16061647408/in/set-72157644065741045" description="Fullmoon bog" %}

At sunrise loud wild sounds woke us. Black grouses had started mating ritual. A dozen of cocks were running around the bog and taking
battles in pairs. The referee was sitting on a tree in the middle. What a game!

We rode bikes to the train station to speed up travel to work.
