# Winter Solstice Adventure

Early winter had been miserable on the South Coast where I live. Two false starts, otherwise dark and wet. I missed snow and ice and the rewarding feeling I get from surviving in cold. 
In the beginning of Christmas holiday I had opportunity to go on a short trip. It was the shortest days of the year. 
In the Southern Finland sun stays over horizon for less than 6 hours. We were going to Jyv채skyl채 in Central Finland with family for the eve anyway. 
There had been already some snow and weather forecast showed sub-zero temperatures up -10C. I started planning the trip to get most out of the available conditions. 
A friend had recommended me to visit the forest of Haukanmaa in Toivakka municipality. Haukanmaa is one of the largest uninhabited areas near Jyv채skyl채. 
There are some forest tracks but no hiking services. Terrain is varying and interesting concentration of small lakes.
