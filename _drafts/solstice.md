# Winter Solstice Adventure

Early winter had been miserable on the South Coast where I live. Two false starts, otherwise dark and wet. 
I missed snow and ice and good feeling I get from surviving in cold. In the beginning of Christmas holiday 
I had opportunity to go on a short trip. Winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, would occur during that time. 
In the Southern Finland sun goes over the horizon for barely 5 hours. Also my lunar calendar shows New moon symbol. 
It was going to be long dark nights. 

Theme of the trip was clear but where would I go. We were going to Jyv채skyl채 in Central Finland with family for 
Christmas Eve. There had already been some snow and weather forecast showed sub-zero temperatures up to -10 degrees in Celsius. 
A friend had recommended me to visit the forest of Haukanmaa in Toivakka municipality. Haukanmaa is one of the largest 
uninhabited areas near Jyv채skyl채. Map shows some forest tracks but I couldn't find any information about fireplaces 
or other hiking services. Which is good, probably won't come accros with anybody! Also found on the map an interesting concentration 
of small lakes in the middle of the forest. I'd try to find a nice campsite there. Wife promised to drop me off on the road 
not too far. Exit plan was more difficult. Haukanmaa is still some 30 km from the town and there is no public transportation.
