# Winter Solstice Adventure

Early winter had been miserable on the South Coast where I live. Two false starts, otherwise dark and wet. 
I missed snow and ice and primitive satisfaction I get from surviving in cold. In the beginning of Christmas holiday 
I had opportunity to go on a short trip. Winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, would occur during that time. 
In the Southern Finland sun goes over the horizon for barely five hours. Also my lunar calendar had New Moon symbol. 
Those together make nigths long and dark. In such conditions natural theme for a trip is to camp in one place 
and do nothing but sit by the campfire.

We were going to Jyväskylä in Central Finland for Christmas with family. 
250 km distance from the coast is enough make conditions a bit more wintry. There would be some snow and weather forecast 
promised sub-zero temperatures up to -10 degrees in Celsius. I wanted do my trip in Central Finland.
A friend had recommended me to visit the forest of Haukanmaa in Toivakka municipality. Haukanmaa is one of the largest 
uninhabited areas near Jyväskylä. Map shows some forest tracks but I couldn't find any information about fireplaces 
or other hiking services. Which is good, probably I won't come accros with anybody. Also found on the map an interesting 
concentration of small lakes in the middle of the forest. I'd try to find a nice campsite there. 

We drove on Sunday the 21st. At sunset, a couple of hours later what I had hoped, my wife dropped me off on a road not 
too far from the lakes. New white snow covered ground and trees. I was surprised to find a fresh track of a car. Must be moose hunters, 
I figured, they are too lazy to walk a shortest distance if car can be used. 
As I had a simple kids' pulka to haul half of my kit I was happy to follow the track rather than trying to make my own through dense 
vegetation.

It felt exciting to be in the forest in quickly darkening night. Lacking an exact destination to orienteer to I forgot to track 
my progress on the map carefully and did a basic mistake. In a crossing I had taken a wrong turn to 
a minor track, followed that for a while and then gone offroad to the direction where I thought the lakes were. 
My pulka didn't work well in the woods, it rolled from every bump. I had gone slowly for about an quarter when I realized 
geography was not matching with the map. I positioned myself with my backup system, phone gps, didn't turn back but pushed through
to another track and approached the lakes from the opposite direction. 

Despite darkness I had plenty of energy to scout the campsite. The first two were not promising. The third one was inside nature reserve. 
The biggest lake, Iilijärvi, was out of question as the map shows three cottages by the lake. I want to find my own lake when possible. 
Also if the lake opened to North, urban lights from Jyväskylä seemed to pollute the scene. I looked up on Iilivuori hill direction. 
South of the highest point were two tiny ponds called Kataislammit. I decided to have a look. The ascent was not long but terrain is rocky.
