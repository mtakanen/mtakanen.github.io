# Hello World
I want to learn telling stories.


## Experiental


## XYZ
I have several kits for outdoors. A kit for hiking in the summer, a kit for winter, a photo kit, and so on. Most people bring some gear when they go out. Might be slightly different, personal preferences, that's fine. I'm not interested in writing much about it. 

Wikipedia knows the domain level domain name xyz is derived from the idea that domain names should end in the same way that the alphabeths do. 
Well, in Finnish we a few more, åäö. I wonder why that is not available. The xyz.com markets itself as domain for the next generation. 
Generation XYZ combines Generations X, Y and Z to create a global community inspired by the Internet and its limitless potential. 
I like that but also derived another meaning from [Cartesian coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). 
XYZ are the three degrees of freedom I operate in the outdoors. The first dimension X represents a straight line, the XY plane horizontal movement and Z vertical. I do them all. 


## Photography
I often go trips with a camera. As my trips are always time boxed I rarely go for photography only. For instance in landscape photography most of the time outdoors is spent finding the optimal perspective and waiting for the best available light conditions. Should those fail one has to go back home with empty memory card and return the same spot the next available time slot. 
I want to exprience more when I go. I'm willing to trade of quality of light a bit. On the other hand I'm not interested in, although sometimes fallback to, 
taking basic snapshots just for documenting what I saw. On most trips I bring a full sensor DSLR and at least one quality lens. At times I carry two lenses and a tripod.
